Impact of Weather Conditions on Household Electricity Consumption
Overview
This dissertation explores the impact of various weather conditions on household electricity consumption using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to understand how different weather factors correlate with electricity usage and to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast electricity consumption based on these weather conditions. The study employs a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network to capture the sequential nature of the data.
