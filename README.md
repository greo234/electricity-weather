How Weather Conditions affect household consumption
Climate and weather significantly affect household electricity consumption, particularly for heating and cooling needs. Understanding this relationship can help optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and improve energy policy decisions. Previous studies have shown that extreme temperatures lead to increased energy consumption, but comprehensive models integrating various weather variables are needed. This study will leverage data from meteorological agencies and London Smart Meter dataset to create a detailed analysis of how weather conditions impact household energy use.
